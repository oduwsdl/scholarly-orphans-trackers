# Scholarly Orphans Trackers

# AS2 Models

The AS2 models for various portals are available in the [models folder](./models).
Each portal in the models folder is split into three directories: `tracker`, `capture`, and `archiver`.
Each of these directories contain models for the `tracker`, `capture`, and `archiver` components of the Scholarly Orphans pipeline.
Under each of these directories, there are AS2 message models for the most common event types for a portal.

All the models are serialized in valid JSON-LD.
They are passed around and are consumed directly by the various components of the framework.
In all the models across various portals, the researcher being tracked is named `Alice`, and only the artifacts `Alice` creates and interacts with are of interest.
Hence, artifacts created by other researchers, even in portals that `Alice` is involved in, are not of interest.
For example, if a researcher named `Bob` contributes to a repository owned by `Alice`, `Alice's` tracker will not record this event.

The AS2 messages generated by the `tracker`, `capture`, and `archiver` components must be based on these models.
To add a new model or to edit an existing model, the following steps must be taken to make sure the models are compatible:

* The JSON must be converted to RDF/XML using [http://www.easyrdf.org/converter](http://www.easyrdf.org/converter).
* The RDF/XML output from the previous step is validated and visualized using:
[https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/).

The RDF conversion and visualization helps keep the model and the graph simple as things can become very complex very fast.
All of the existing models have been validated by performing the steps above, so any existing model can be used for comparison when creating any new model.
